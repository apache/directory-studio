The createDEB.sh script creates the Debian package for a release of Apache Directory Studio on a Debian based distribution.

To create a Debian package, you have to put in the "/package/usr/local/apachedirectorystudio" folder the following files:
  * ApacheDirectoryStudio (the application)
  * configuration folder
  * features folder
  * plugins folder
  * LICENSE.txt
  * NOTICE.txt
  * Release Notes.txt

Then, you can launch the shell script: ./createDEB.sh

An "ApacheDirectoryStudio.deb" Debian package will be generated.
